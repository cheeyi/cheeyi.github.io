My first name is _Chee Yi_ (thatâ€™s two words), and my last name is _Ong_. Iâ€™m a software engineer at [Punch Through][punchthrough] working on projects with a focus on Bluetooth Low Energy connected devices. I love gaming, photography, food and travel. My hometown is a beautiful island in Malaysia called Penang.

I graduated from the University of Minnesota Twin Cities with a B.S. in Computer Engineering before spending about 2.5 years in the United States working for tech companies and getting valuable experience before returning home to Penang, where I currently reside.

As someone who graduated university in 2015, Iâ€™m still pretty new to the workforce. Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™ve been up to lately (in reverse chronological order):

# Punch Through

**[Punch Through][punchthrough]** is such an amazing place to work at, Iâ€™m lost for words. ðŸ˜„

Punch Through is a small startup-sized engineering firm that specializes in building Bluetooth connected productsâ€”specifically BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) products. I write Android, macOS and iOS apps here for the company's internal products as well as for external client projects. Learning BLE has been a very fulfilling experience for me and writing code that interacts with real physical devices is very, very cool.

A lot of my work here at Punch Through are under NDA, but our internal work are not. Since I joined the company in 2017 I've shipped a couple of major product updates:

- Released [LightBlueÂ® Explorer for Android][lbx-android], our flagship Bluetooth development utility for other developers â€” see the announcement blog post **[here][lbx-android-announcement]**.
- Released the Cloud Connect feature for [LightBlueÂ® Explorer on iOS][lbx-ios], a feature allowing incoming Bluetooth data to be sent to cloud platforms such as AWS IoT and Adafruit IO. Announcement blog post **[here][cloud-connect-announcement]**.

After I left the U.S. in April 2018, I still maintain a working relationship with Punch Through as a freelance worker.

# Expedia

My first real job out of university, I was an iOS software engineer during my time with Expedia. Iâ€™ve had the pleasure of working on a world-class, award-winning appâ€”the official Expedia app on iOS.

I was one of the first few engineers to pioneer the usage of Appleâ€™s Swift programming language on the team, and so I've had the opportunity to define general and testing best practices as well as programming paradigms like the MVVM model. Our team shipped one of the biggest feature releases for the Expedia iOS app, namely the Packages feature which allows users to book a bundled deal that includes hotel stays and flights.

Iâ€™ve also had the opportunity to work with amazing, cross-functional teams based out of Minneapolis, Chicago, San Francisco and Gurgaon in India. Working with a team of this scale has taught me how a big team functions as a whole, starting from the VP to the product managers, technical product managers, designers, engineering managers, engineering team leads and my fellow engineers.

# Institute of Mathematics and its Applications

When I was a student at the University of Minnesotaâ€”aside from the obvious extra pocket moneyâ€”I wanted to experience what it was like to work and having to study at the same time. The IMA is a mathematical institution located inside the U of M that hosts scholars from all over the world as they conduct researches. I worked as a Systems team staff member, reporting to the Systems Administrator. I was responsible for automating department-wide deployment of software packages, and I also learned how to use the Unix terminal effectively as it was the departmentâ€™s OS of choice.

# Pentamaster

I was an intern at Pentamaster during summer 2013. Pentamaster is a Malaysian corporation that specializes in providing industrial automation solutions to other companies. I was exposed to the power of computer vision in determining defective products in the factory pipeline, and had the chance to write and deliver software of such nature.
