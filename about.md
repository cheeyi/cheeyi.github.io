My first name is _Chee Yi_ (that’s two words), and my last name is _Ong_. I’m a software engineer at [Punch Through][punchthrough] working on projects with a focus on Bluetooth Low Energy connected devices. I love gaming, photography, food and travel. My hometown is a beautiful island in Malaysia called Penang.

I graduated from the University of Minnesota Twin Cities with a B.S. in Computer Engineering, after which I spent about 2.5 years in the United States working for tech companies and getting valuable experience before returning home to Penang, where I currently reside.
