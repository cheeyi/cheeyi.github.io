# Professional Work Experience

As someone who graduated university in 2015, Iâ€™m still pretty new to the workforce, but I think I've gained lots of valuable experience over the past few years. I can be contacted via email at cheeyi[a#t]g#mail[d#ot]com. Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™ve been up to lately (in reverse chronological order):

## Punch Through

**[Punch Through][punchthrough]** is such an amazing place to work at, Iâ€™m lost for words. ðŸ˜„

Punch Through is a small startup-sized engineering and product development firm that specializes in building Bluetooth connected productsâ€”specifically BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) products. I write Android, macOS and iOS apps here for the company's internal products as well as for external client projects. 

Learning BLE has been a very fulfilling experience for me and writing code that interacts with real physical devices never gets old. I've come to learn about, be frustrated at, and finally understand and be at peace with the nuances and quirks of working with the Android and iOS Bluetooth APIs.

A lot of my work here at Punch Through are under NDA by our clients, so I can't tell you about those, but I *can* tell you about Punch Through's internal products that aren't under NDA. Since I joined the company in 2017 I've shipped a couple of major product releases and updates:

- Released **[LightBlueÂ® Explorer for Android][lbx-android]**, our flagship Bluetooth development utility for other developers â€” see the announcement blog post **[here][lbx-android-announcement]{:target="_blank"}** and a LinkedIn post by Mike, Punch Through's president **[here][lbx-android-mike-linkedin-post]{:target="_blank"}/[image][lbx-android-mike-linkedin-post-image]{:target="_blank"}**.
- Released the Cloud Connect feature for **[LightBlueÂ® Explorer on iOS][lbx-ios]**, a feature allowing incoming Bluetooth data to be sent to cloud platforms such as AWS IoT and Adafruit IO. Announcement blog post **[here][cloud-connect-announcement]{:target="_blank"}**.

After I left the U.S. in April 2018, I still maintain a great working relationship with Punch Through as a freelance worker.

## Expedia

My first real job out of university, I was an iOS software engineer during my time with Expedia. Iâ€™ve had the pleasure of working on a world-class, award-winning appâ€”the official Expedia app on iOSâ€”with amazing, cross-functional teams based out of Minneapolis, Chicago, San Francisco and Gurgaon in India. Working with a team of this scale has taught me how a big team functions as a whole, starting from the VP to the product managers, technical product managers, designers, engineering managers, engineering team leads and my fellow engineers.

I was one of the first few engineers to pioneer the usage of Appleâ€™s Swift programming language on the team, and so I've had the opportunity to define general and testing best practices as well as programming paradigms like the MVVM model. Our team shipped one of the biggest feature releases for the Expedia iOS app, namely the Packages feature which allows users to book a bundled deal that includes hotel stays and flights. I also learned about the beauty of TDD (Test-Driven Development) and writing maintainable, scalable tests and production code.

Another interesting thing I did was to use Jenkins to schedule a HP Fortify job that runs every night to scan the Expedia iOS code base for vulnerabilities specific to PCI compliance.

## Institute of Mathematics and its Applications

When I was a student at the University of Minnesotaâ€”aside from the obvious extra pocket moneyâ€”I wanted to experience what it was like to work and having to study at the same time. The IMA is a mathematical institution located inside the U of M that hosts scholars from all over the world as they conduct researches. I worked as a Systems team staff member, reporting to the Systems Administrator. I was responsible for automating department-wide deployment of software packages, and I also learned how to use the Unix terminal effectively as it was the departmentâ€™s OS of choice.

## Pentamaster

I was an intern at Pentamaster during summer 2013. Pentamaster is a Malaysian corporation that specializes in providing industrial automation solutions to other companies. I was exposed to the power of computer vision in determining defective products in the factory pipeline, and had the chance to write and deliver software of such nature.
