# cheeyi.github.io

This is my humble attempt at a personal website that acts both as a rarely-updated blog and a résumé.

## Setup

1. Clone (or fork, if you wish) this repo:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cheeyi/cheeyi.github.io.git
```

2. Run `bundle install` from command line to set up dependencies
3. Posts are located in the `_posts` directory, so feel free to modify them or add new posts.
4. Once you're satisfied, you'll need to build the site. From the [Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/):

> Jekyll is a static site generator so we need Jekyll to build the site before we can view it. There are two commands you can run in the root of your site to build it:
> 
> * `bundle exec jekyll build` - Builds the site and outputs a static site to a directory called `_site`.
> * `bundle exec jekyll serve` - Does the same thing except it rebuilds any time you make a change and runs a local web server at http://localhost:4000.

## Updating dependencies

1. Update `Gemfile` as you see fit.
2. Run `bundle update`.
